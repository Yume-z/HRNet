# HRNet and Transformer in vertebrae keypoint detection

In this project, an end-to-end and non-local neural network based on HRNet and transformer module is proposed, which can extract high-resolution and global feature from AP X-ray vertebrae images in parallel. The keypoints estimation of this model has reached an accuracy of 0.8, and the model is still being optimized to get better results. 

This project is implemented in Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.10. The training is based on CentOS (Linux) 7.6 system, using CUDA (11.4) for GPU parallel computing and cuDNN (8.2) for computing acceleration.
